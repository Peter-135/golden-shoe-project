            (A reason for contacting customer service) Website not updated
            regularly to show which items are in stock (sometimes shows as in

          <p>
            (Another reason for contacting customer service) Queries around

            Top reasons for returning items: Incorrect shoe size (38%), didn't

          </p>
          <p>Improve online presence (great for marketing)</p>
          <p>
            Create a new, modern website and a mobile app that are regularly
            updated (stock regularly updated, improve conversion rate more
            customers buy)

            Improve customer service by allowing more than just phone calls to

          <p className="center-text">
            A focus on creating a new website and creating a mobile app would
            lead to:{" "}
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Higher revenue for the company</b> (leading to higher profits),
            as customers stay longer because the website design is easy to look
            and navigate, as well as products being regularly updated so the
            company have more reliable product
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>A more effective, stronger team</b>, leading to reduced costs for
            the company (again improving overall profits) as the Golden Shoes'
            staff understand Agile ways of working, increasing team
            collabration, producing shorter delivery cycles providing value to
            both clients and customers, and efficiency through continous
            improvement through constant testing and experimentation
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>An increase in user base (no. of users)</b>, as customer service
            and products improve for the shoes, customers will tell their
            friends and family about all the positives Golden Shoe
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Higher rates of customer satisfaction</b> As customers can easily
            contact the relevant departments when issues arise and can be
            solved, and stock is regularly updated
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>A stronger brand name</b>, as social media accounts like facebook
            and twitter are updated regularly and customers know what new
            products Golden Shoe are creating. This would also solve the problem
            of customers disliking the shoe style or colour, as there will be
            greater variety to choose from which customer will be aware of
            because of social media and the regularly updated website
          </p>

          <p className="center-text">
            Therefore the focus should be on{" "}
            <strong>updating the website</strong> and creating a mobile app,
            which finally leads to our prototype design for the website which is
